A static site generator in OCaml 🐸 🐫

I used to generate my site with [Frog][1], decided to try my hand at a
static-site generator more to my own needs, and now we have this froggy-themed
derivation. Powers [morepablo.com][2].

## Building/hacking

With `dune` and `opam` installed, create a local switch (`opam switch create .`).
I _think_ this should create an environment where the rest of the Make commands
work.
