# Small fruit

- Dune/JBuilder
- Template "new post" as a param
- Templates for various pages as strings in model (iterative shell, reduce filesystem in builder)
- Sample blog (starter)
- OPAM-ing (redundant with Dune?)
- GitHub releases
- GitHub Pages user docs. Bootstrapped, of course!

# Wishlist

- CSS inline header bits?
- JSON feed lol?
- cache (rebuild only when necessary)
- parallelization?
- generalize to allow other blogs?

- Learn to profile OCaml code?
- Learn to optimize builds for smaller binary size?

# Eh, maybe

- Tests?
- Descriptive logging?
- ocamldoc?

- ocamllint
